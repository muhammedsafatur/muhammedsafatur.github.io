# Muhammed Safa Tur - Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. It is configured for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions.

## 🚀 GitHub Pages Deployment

To enable automatic deployment:

1.  **Push to main**: Any push to the `main` branch will trigger the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" action.
2.  **GitHub Settings**:
    *   Go to your repository on GitHub.
    *   Navigate to **Settings** > **Pages**.
    *   Under **Build and deployment** > **Source**, ensure it is set to **GitHub Actions**.
3.  **Check Actions**: You can monitor the progress in the **Actions** tab of your repository.

## 🛠️ Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production

```
